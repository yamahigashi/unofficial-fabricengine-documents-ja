msgid ""
"Reduce the use or generated functions. A lot of the functions exposed on the"

"confusing for new users."
msgstr ""

#: ..\..\source\ReleaseNotes\1.8.0-beta.rst:101
msgid ""
"Make the code more readable and therefore easy to learn. We have reduced the"

"The scene graph node constructors in the past took only keyword arguments, "
