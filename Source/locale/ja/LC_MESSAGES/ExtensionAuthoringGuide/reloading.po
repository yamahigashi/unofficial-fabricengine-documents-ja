"In general reloading a KL extension is most useful when the memory layout of"
" extension types and their function prototypes do not need to change but the"

"The relevant API functions for reloading KL extension code are "
"`FEC_ClientLoadExtension` and `FEC_RegisterKLExtension` in the C API and "
"`Client::loadExtension()` and `RegisterKLExtension` in the C++ and Python "
"APIs. See :ref:`clients` for more information on these functions and their "
"parameters. The `reload` parameter on these functions is new, if set to 0 "
"then these functions will error out as they would in the past if a user "
"tries to load an extension that's already been loaded, however if set to 1 "
"then that extension will be reloaded from disk (or from the provided source "
"code in the case of `RegisterKLExtension`)."

"The memory representation or member layout of a KL type can not be changed "
"by reloading an extension and will result in an error if the user tries. In "
"order to change the memory representation of KL type all Core Clients must "
"be shut down and restarted. For example attempting to add a member to a "

"In the case of an extension which is dependent on a reloaded one, the "

"change the implementation of the inlined `foo()` the `Bar` extension would "
"need to be recompiled and the Core does not automatically reload dependent "

"If the prototype of an existing KL function is changed inside an extension "
"(to change the parameter types, or add or remove parameters) or if new "
"functions are added or removed then any new KL code written against this "
"extension will be able to use the new functions, however any existing code "
"in dependent extensions that still refer to the old function prototypes will"
" continue to work but will use the old function. This can lead to confusing "
"scenarios where dependent extensions are using KL functions that may no "
"longer exist in any visible way."
