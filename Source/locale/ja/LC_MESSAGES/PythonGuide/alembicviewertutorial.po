"The new Python Bindings for the FabricUI allows users to work directly in"
" Python and quickly prototype, iterate, and build custom applications "
"around Fabric Engine. Python is the industry standard programming "
"language for Technical Directors and Technical Artists in VFX. Its simple"
" syntax makes it easier for users to pick up, learn and build tools with."
" In previous release of Fabric Engine, users would have to build custom "
"applications using C++ which greatly increased the entry point for "
"developing custom applications on top of Fabric Engine. Now, users can do"
" this faster and more simply."

"This tutorial will result in users having built a small Alembic Viewer "
"application that lists the Alembic archive files within a selected "
"directory. User can select the Alembic files from the list and review "
"their content in the 3D viewport while scrubbing through the timeline to "
"see them in motion. We'll be creating this custom application based on "
"the canvas.py and CanvasWindow.py files that are included with Fabric "
"Engine. Additionally, we'll be creating a few custom PySide widgets "
"implementing custom signals to execute commands in the graph and update "
"the application with new data."

"The first step is to create a custom directory where your application "
"will live. Copy the ``canvas.py`` and ``CanvasWindow.py`` files into your"
" custom directory and rename them to logical names relating to your "
"custom application. In our case we'll rename ``canvas.py`` to "
"``alembic_viewer.py`` and ``CanvasWindow.py`` to "
"``AlembicViewWindow.py``."

"It is recommended to create a custom launcher file (similar to the "
"``prompt.bat`` and ``prompt.sh`` that ship with Fabric) to allow users to"
" easily run your application. This launcher file needs to call the "
"environment.bat or environment.sh file that is shipped in the main "
"directory of the Fabric Engine release folder. This makes sure that the "
"Fabric Engine environment is setup so that the Fabric Engine client that "
"will be running our application graph, can started. The parent directory "
"of the custom application has to be added to the :envar:PYTHONPATH "
"environment variable as well. This will ensure that the custom widgets "
"will be available with Python import calls. Lastly the file should then "
"launch the Python startup file. An example of the launcher script we ship"
" is below."
