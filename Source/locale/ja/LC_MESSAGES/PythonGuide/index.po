"Fabric has offered Python bindings for the Core C++ API for some time but"
" new to version 2.2.0 is a PySide-compatible wrapping of the FabricUI "
"user-interface library, allowing users to build complete standalone "
"Fabric-based tools in Python. There is also a higher-level Canvas Python "
"module which wraps much of the FabricUI functionality and makes it "
"accessible in a way that's easier for building custom Python "
"applications."

"The Canvas module and the FabricUI Python bindings are still a work in "
