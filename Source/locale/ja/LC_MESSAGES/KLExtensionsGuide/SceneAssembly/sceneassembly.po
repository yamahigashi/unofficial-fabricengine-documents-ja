"The scene assembly is the procedural scene processing portion of the "
":ref:`SceneHub<scenehub>`. It consist of a processing graph containing "
"nodes that query, filter, merge or augment scene element groups. It "
"includes, too, a set of interfaces for abstracting the scene "
"implementation while allowing for efficient, asynchronous processing, "
"which is implemented by the :ref:`SceneGraph<scenegraph_overview>`."

"The :kl-ref:`SceneWrapper` interface is the main interface for "
