About This Release
------------------

Fabric Engine 2.2  is focused on improving accessibility and addressing popular feature requests while also fixing a bunch of quirks and bugs. All of which adds up to a better everyday Fabric experience.  Listed below are some highlights. Check out this `What's New In Fabric Engine 2.2 video`_ for a quick tour.

.. _What's New In Fabric Engine 2.2 video: https://vimeo.com/166058984
 

- Python! Canvas has been converted to a Python app making it straightforward to create purpose-built applications. Using the source code to the Canvas python files, you can automate the creation and modification of Canvas graphs without needing to know C++. 
- A simple Alembic Asset Viewer application is included as an example of how ``canvas.py`` can be modified to create a new app. See below for more details.
- We’ve also integrated a Script Editor complete with syntax highlighting of Python code that makes it really convenient to edit scripts within the ``canvas.py`` standalone.
- For KL programmers, we’ve added code completion within Canvas. We’ve got lots of ideas on how to continue to improve this, but it’s pretty handy as-is so we thought we’d share it as soon as possible. 
- Starting Fabric Engine 2.2 is about twice as fast as before.
- Drag-and-drop port reordering. You asked for it. We added it. You’ll love it.
- Execute Ports allow you to control execution of parts of a Canvas graph.  For example, an "If" node can use execute ports on its "then" and "else" connections to decide between two different parts of the graph to be executed. They can also be used to support simple looping. A more complete solution for looping in Canvas is in the works.
- Fabric for MODO! We are pleased to promote the MODO integration from Beta to officially supported and distributed as part of Fabric Engine 2.2. The Fabric for MODO plugin is compatible with MODO 901 through to MODO 10.0 and is available on Windows, Linux and OS X. Now tools that you build in Fabric can run in Maya, Softimage or MODO.
- We fixed over 250 issues (the most relevant are listed below).

Supported Operating Systems, Integrations and GPUs
--------------------------------------------------

- Fabric 2.2 is supported on Windows and Linux. OS X builds are provided but are not officially supported; official support on OS X will arrive in a subsequent release.
- Fabric for Maya integration is supported for Autodesk Maya 2014, 2015 and 2016 and their corresponding service packs and extensions on Windows and Linux. Maya 2016 Extension 2 was released too close to the release of Fabric 2.2 for us to be able to support it. Watch the daily builds for an update. OS X support will follow in a subsequent release. There is a known issue where certain sample scenes fail when Maya 2016 is in Parallel Evaluation mode. This problem was resolved by Autodesk in Maya 2016 SP4.
- Fabric for Softimage integration is supported for Autodesk Softimage 2014 and 2015 and their corresponding service packs on Windows.
- Fabric for MODO integration is compatible with MODO 901 through to MODO 10.0 and is available on Windows, Linux and OS X.
- Fabric 2 GPU support is available on NVIDIA hardware. See the GPU Compute Guide in the documentation for more details.

.. _changes-2.2.0:

Changes
-------

**Python**

For more information on setup and running the new ``canvas.py`` see the :ref:`GETTINGSTARTED_STANDALONE`.

A simple Alembic Asset Viewer application is provided as an example of how source files to ``canvas.py`` can be modified to create your own application with minimal changes. This `Fabric Apps With Python video`_ walks you through the process.

.. _Fabric Apps With Python video: https://vimeo.com/165860125

**Script Editor**

The new Script Editor includes syntax highlighting and can execute python code. The Script Editor also echoes the python commands reflecting the Canvas actions in the graph, allowing you to create scripts that programmatically create Canvas graphs. These scripts can be loaded inside ``canvas.py`` by using the ``-s`` flag. 


**KL Code Completion**

The KL Editor code window offers basic code completion of objects and methods. Typing Ctrl-spacebar brings up the code completion menu (i.e: If you're on a new line and type "V" it will bring up a list with objects that start with "V" like Vec2, Vec3, etc). The code completion will also list the methods of an object and their signature.


**Drag-and-Drop port reordering**

You can now drag-and-drop exposed ports directly to reorder them instead of relying on the context menu.


**Execute Ports**

We have included two samples showcasing the use of execute ports:

- ``ForLoop.canvas`` shows the execution of different subgraphs blocks within an Execute.Merge4 node driven by a For node.
- ``ForLoop_KochCurve.canvas`` renders a Koch snowflake curve by iterating the subdivision of a line using the Koch curve construction rules (and storing the intermediate results for each iteration in a var). See :ref:`canvas-programmer-guide-execute-ports-explicit` for more information on Execute Ports.


**Fabric for MODO**

As of Fabric Engine 2.2 the MODO integration is now officially supported and distributed as part of the installation inage. The Fabric for MODO plugin is compatible with MODO 901 through to MODO 10.0 and available on Windows, Linux and OS X.  For more details, see the :ref:`MODO` documentation and this `Fabric for MODO introductory video`_.

.. _Fabric for MODO introductory video: https://vimeo.com/155506576


.. note:: ``canvas.py`` **Is Replacing** ``canvas.exe``
 
 Please use ``canvas.py`` to launch Canvas (see the :ref:`GETTINGSTARTED_STANDALONE` for details). The C++ canvas executable is being provided for a brief transitional period since it is now deprecated. It will be removed in a future version, most likely the next feature release. They are functionally identical (with the exception of the addition of the Script Editor for Python to ``canvas.py``).

.. _knownissues-2.2.0:

Known Issues, Limitations and Workarounds
-----------------------------------------

- **Limitation**: Saving Presets won’t include the attached comment (FE-4900)

    Workaround: Use the node tooltip property instead 


**Fabric for MODO Limitations**

- Support for Fabric’s Inline Drawing requires changes to MODO. We are working with The Foundry to provide a way for Fabric to draw into the MODO viewport in future releases of MODO and Fabric for MODO.

- The procedural mesh item (CanvasPI) does not yet support meshes as input (outputs however are supported). We plan to support Input Mesh Ports in a future release of Fabric for MODO [FABMODO-29]

- Per-polygon normals are not yet implemented. [FABMODO-17]

- The evaluation context's data and the associated presets ("EvalContext") are currently not set in Fabric for Modo and return empty values. [FABMODO-15]
