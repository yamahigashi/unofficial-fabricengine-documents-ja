Important Notes - Read Me First!
--------------------------------

- This is a bugfix release; please refer to the :ref:`RELNOTES-1.15.0` for more general information about the 1.15.0 release.

Major Improvements in 1.15.1
--------------------------------

- The cached load time of Fabric applications has been greatly reduced, by more than 50% in most cases.

- The extenion load times reporting by Fabric are now correct and much more intuitive.

- Several important bugs in the GPU memory allocator have been fixed.

- Total number of bytes allocated insize to the storage of a variable array is no longer limited to 2^32-1.

- Added :code:`.setDirty()` method to Core and Splice API to allow manual setting of dependency graph nodes to dirty, forcing them to evaluate the next time even if the inputs haven't changed.

Comprehensive Changes
---------------------------------

- Splice: Add graph and node infomation to :code:`getDGPortInfo()`

- Geometry: Fix for polygon edge

- AlembicWrapper: Adding public accessors so client code can parse extra data in the file. (e.g. Horde)

- Core: Exposed :code:`Fabric_Debug` constant so extensions can tell if they are running with ``FABRIC_DEBUG`` set.

- Math: Only dump stacks for warnings when :code:`Fabric_Debug` is true.

- Geometry: PolygonMesh: added a simple "delete unused points" method

- Geometry: added :code:`PolygonMesh.getPolygonSubTrianglePolygonPoints()` and :code:`PolygonMesh.getPolygonSubTriangleCount()`.

- Core: Variable arrays: Add :code:`.reserve()` method to variable arrays to pre-allocation of space.  Changed behaviour of :code:`.resize()` method so that it resizes to exactly the requested size if the size was previously 0.

- Documentation: Remove deprecation warnings for :code:`Scalar` and :code:`Size` types.

- Core: Don't throw exceptions on IR cache deletion errors

- Core: Remember variable array memory location for empty arrays, so that array storage locality can be controlled before the data is added.

- Core: Fix crash in GPU allocator free function

- Core: Big improvements in cached load time

- Core: Make extension load time messages more intuitive

- Core: Total number of bytes allocated insize to the storage of a variable array is no longer limited to 2^32-1.

- Core: Fixed an issue with assigning unowned objects to themselves.

- Core: Fixed an issue with defining :code:`appendDesc()` for objects.

- Core: Reduce memory usage during KL parsing by removing right-recursion from the KL grammar.
