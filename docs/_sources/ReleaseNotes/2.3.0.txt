About This Release
------------------

This 2.3 release of Fabric Engine introduces Blocks, which fundamentally changes what is possible with Canvas while at the same time making Canvas even easier to use! See below for more on this and many other additions.

**Blocks**

Everything you thought you knew about Fabric is changed by Blocks. They take Canvas
visual programming from "this is cool, but I wish I didn’t have to resort to writing code for some
things" to "this is freaking awesome, now I can do it all graphically". We have included many samples in the Blocks folder and some presets that leverage the Block architecture such as:

- ``ForLoop`` Traditional For Loop
- ``AccumulateWhile`` A While which iterates over an array and accumulates the value of each iteration with an exit condition
- ``Filter``  Filters an array based on a condition defined in the block 
- ``Geometry Deform``  Iterates through the positions of a Geometry primitive and exposes a block to modify each of them
- ``Image Modify``  Iterates through the pixels of an Image and exposes a block to modify each of them
- ``AnyElementMatches`` Iterates over an array and tests a block on each element; as soon as an element matches, it returns true; otherwise it returns false

There are two new sections in the documentation for Blocks and the What's New video also provides a good introduction and overview:

- :ref:`The Blocks section of the Canvas User Guide <canvas-user-guide-blocks>`
- :ref:`The Blocks section of the Canvas Programmer Guide <canvas-programming-guide-blocks>`
- `What's New In Fabric Engine 2.3 video`_

**Revamped Function Node editor**

Now you can create and edit ports in the Function Editor a much more visual workflow for removing, dragging and dropping and editing metadata. You can also create blocks which can be pulled within the KL editor.

**UX Improvements**

Apart than the new Function Node Editor, we have made many UI/UX Improvements including:

- Middle mouse button navigation support
- A recent file list in the File Menu
- Improved positioning of the tab search widget
- Improved color highlighting and font size on the log widget
- Autoscrolling on the log widget
- It is now possible to select the data type of a port inside a subgraph
- Improved the contrast in the code completion window
- Clicking on the sliders will set the value based on the clicked position
- Improved Canvas header controls (to go back and split presets)
- Ability to expose a port from the outside of a graph, or by clicking the header

**Alembic improvements**

We have improved the Alembic extensions with many bugfixes that make it more reliable and flexible.


**Basic Linear Algebra Extension**

A very basic library that adds support for complex numbers, arbitrary matrices with Cholesky decomposition, quadratic programming etc.


**Increased stability in Fabric for Maya and Maya 2016 Extension 2 support**

Fabric Engine 2.3.0 has fixed a number of Fabric for Maya issues and includes support for Maya 2016 Extension 2.

Support
-------

Fabric Engine 2.3.0 is available for free use under Evaluation, Studio or Educational licenses and is also available under commercial terms. Commercial customers are entitled to contact Fabric directly for Support. Non-commercial customers are encouraged to use the following options:

- http://forums.fabricengine.com : Ask & answer questions within the Fabric community. This is where you should post your support issues.
- mailto://bugs@fabricengine.com : If you have found a bug you can email us with clear steps to reproduce the issue (be sure to include details on what operating system and DCC application and their respective versions that you are using). Please note that we will respond only if additional information is required to resolve an issue with the Fabric platform.

.. _knownissues-2.3.0:

Maya 2016 Ext 2 on OS X now requires using the "OpenGL Strict" profile. This is a change from previous versions of Maya 2016 and will cause the following error message to be displayed in the viewport: "Current drawing engine does not support legacy viewport." In order to allow Fabric's Inline Drawing to work you need set “OpenGL Legacy” mode in the Maya Windows Settings/Preferences dialogue. You will find it at the bottom of the Viewport 2.0 section. 


.. _changes-2.3.0:

Changes
-------

- Added canvas.bat and canvas.sh to make launching canvas easier.
- The JSON extension API has changed which might lead in behaviour changee behaviour for existing code relying on it. 
- New array presets Sum, Product, Average, Min, Max have been added.
- New preset 'ReportInChunks' and new sample 'Miscellaneous/report_in_chunks' have been added.
- We removed the menu items of the deprecated Splice nodes to tidy up the Fabric main menu. Note that these actions can still be accessed via MEL and Python.
- The default framerate in Canvas Standalone is now '60.0 fps' rather than 'max fps'.
- New menu items added to Fabric for Maya: 'Import/Export Graph' and 'Select Canvas Node/Item' to select the Maya Canvas node being displayed in Canvas.
- "Open Documentation" now attempts to open the documentation locally first and, if that fails, it switches to the online version.
- GenericValue.getValueType() was changed to return the Type instead of a String of that type. For arrays, this means that instead of returning "TypeArray" it will return "Type[]" if converted to a String.
